        <h1>CS347: Project 1 Report</h1>
        <h2>Client: Crepesville Restaurant</h2>
        <p>The theme of my project was to create a website for a restaurant that
            specializes in making crepes. I wanted to the website to reflect the 
            restaurant's mission and showcase the  overall family-friendly feel 
            of this restaurant to the customers. 
        </p>
        <h2>Content Originality</h2>
        <p>To set the cozy and joyful mood, I handpicked high-quality pictures from creative commons 
            - pexels.com and unsplash.com. I have also incorporated different html techniques learned
            in our labs such as utilizing the flexbox layout for alignment, javascript to manipulate
            some animations, and grid-layout to establish the overall layout of each html page. I also
            used W3Schools and codepen.com as a reference for creating some html elements such as 
            forms and animations. All of the other contents are my own work. 
        </p>
        <h2>Site pages</h2>
        <p>There in total five pages: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homepage</li>
                <li>Menu</li>
                <li>Make a Researvation</li>
                <li>Our Story</li>
                <li>Gallery</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Header and navigational links</h2>
        <p>The header of my site includes the logo on top left corner
            and navigation links to each page on the right corner.
        </p>
        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p>My site utilizes media queries to support distinct layouts for different 
            screen specializes such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.
        </p>
        <h2>Coherent style across all pages</h2>
        <p> My website maintains a fairly consistent design throughout 
            all pages. The first four pages (homepage, menu, make a reservation, and our story)
            have a similar layout and structure. The gallery uses a slightly different structure
            but the style still remains the same. Navigation bar/header is consistent throughout
            all pages.
        </p>
        <h2>Alt attributes for images and favicons</h2>
        <p> All images on my site have their descriptive alt attributes and each page
            declares its favicon (same one throughout all pages).
        </p>
        <h2>Organization of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files</h2>
        <p> All of images are organized in the images folder, css in the css folder,
            and JavaScript in the js folder. I have not used any other frameworks or
            libraries and used only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the entire website.
        </p>
        <h2>Nu Validator</h2>
        <p> All of my html and css files were able to pass the Nu Validor. </p>
        <h2>Alignment and Font faces</h2>
        <p> All of my texts and pictures are clearly aligned and visible 
            throughout all screen sizes. Most of the alignment used is 
            left-alignment. I used Roboto as my main font for paragraphs and some
            headings, but used Dancing Script for the logo and Piazzolla for a heading
            on Our Story page.
        </p>
        <h2>Form, External Links and Animation</h2>
        <p>I have two forms on Make a Reservation page - a subscription input form and
        a feedback form. There is an animation, powered by CSS and JavaScript on the subscription, 
        form when the submit button is clicked. I referenced the code provided on an 
        open source learning platform - codepen.It incorporates the same elements we have 
        learned in class such as adding  a class to an html element on a certain event. 
        I have customized the code toput some of my own design preferences and functionality on it.</p>
        <p>External links that give credits to photos used on the website are on 
         the Gallery page.
        </p>
        <h2>Source code readability</h2>
        <p> My source code is organized and 
            uses conventional and consistent formatting and
            meaningful names for classes throughout all pages.
        </p>
        <h2>Git repository and file names</h2>
        <p> My site is stored in Git repository and is shared with the
            user twodee as a collaborator. All the names of my files are lowercase
            and contain only alphanumeric characters.
        </p>
        <h2>Domain name and port 443</h2>
        <p>My domain name is susienguyen.me and my project is served out
        over HTTPS on port 443. My site automatically redirects
        to port 443 for users who access my site over HTTP on port 80.
        </p>
        <h2>Steady flow of commits</h2>
        <p>I wasn't able to meet this requiremnt as my  Git repository does not 
        show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project.</p>
